    <p class="main-text">In the novels, Hogwarts is somewhere in Scotland.[10][11] (The film Prisoner of
        Azkaban says that Dufftown is near.) The school is depicted as having numerous
        charms and spells on and around it that make it impossible for a Muggle to locate it
        . Muggles cannot see the school; rather, they see only ruins and several warnings of dange
        r.[GF Ch.11] The castle's setting is described as having extensive grounds with sloping la
        wns, flowerbeds and vegetable patches, a loch (called The Black Lake), a large dense forest
        (called the Forbidden Forest), several greenhouses and other outbuildings, and a full-size
        Quidditch pitch. There is also an owlery, which houses all the owls owned by the school and t
        hose owned by students. Some rooms in the school tend to "move around", and so do the stairs in
        the grand staircase.[12] Witches and wizards cannot Apparate or Disapparate in Hogwarts grounds
        , except when the Headmaster lifts the enchantment, whether only in certain areas or for the entire
        campus, so as to make the school less vulnerable when it serves the headmaster to allow Apparition.[G
        F Ch.28] Electricity and electronic devices are not found at Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Goblet o
        f Fire, Hermione indicates that due to the high levels of magic, "substitutes for magic (that) Muggles u
        se" such as computers, radar and electricity "go haywire" around Hogwarts. Radios however, make an exception.
        Rowling explains this by saying that the radios are not powered by electricity but by magic.
        Hogwarts is on the shore of a lake, sometimes called the Black Lake. In that lake are merpeople, Grindylows,
        and a giant squid. The giant squid does not attack humans and sometimes acts as a lifeguard when
        students are in the lake.
        Hogwarts is a coeducational, secondary boarding school, taking children from ages eleven to eighteen
        .[4] Education at Hogwarts is not compulsory, with some students being home schooled as stated in the seventh
        book. Rowling initially said there are about one thousand students at Hogwarts.[13] She later suggested around
        six hundred, while acknowledging that this number was still inconsistent with the small number of people in Harry's
        year. She further explained that this had resulted from her creating only 40 characters for Harry's year.[14]
        Rowling has said that Hogwarts is "a multifaith school".[15] She has further stated on the subject, "The only people
        I never imagined there are Wiccans."[16] In response to the query, "[D]o you think there are a lot of LGBT students in m
        odern age Hogwarts? I like to imagine they formed an LGBT club," Rowling replied, "But of course."[17]</p>
